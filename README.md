## Introduction

TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds static typing to the language. This repository provides hands-on examples and exercises to solidify your understanding of TypeScript's features, helping you write more robust and maintainable code.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (LTS recommended)
- npm or Yarn (npm comes with Node.js)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mrpunkdasilva/learn-typescript.git
   cd learn-typescript
   ```
2. Navigate into each sub-project directory (e.g., `advanced-generic-types`, `arrays`) and install their respective dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd advanced-generic-types
   npm install # or yarn install
   ```
   Repeat this for any module you wish to explore.

## Folder Structure

The repository is organized into several modules, each focusing on a specific area of TypeScript.

## Modules Covered

### Advanced Generic Types

Explores complex generic type scenarios, including type mapping, conditional types, and constraining generic parameters.

### Arrays

Covers various ways to work with arrays in TypeScript, including type inference, tuple types, and enums.

### Classes and Interfaces

Deep dive into object-oriented programming with TypeScript, focusing on classes, interfaces, inheritance, and abstract classes.

### Functions

Examples demonstrating function types, overloaded functions, optional parameters, and more.

### Generic Types

Introduces the concept of generic types to create reusable components that work with a variety of data types.

### Objects

Working with object types, property modifiers, and advanced object patterns.

### Essential TypeScript

A structured course-like content covering fundamental to intermediate TypeScript concepts.
